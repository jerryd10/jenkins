[b][i]Ju Bashi-se no Chedo[/i], "Thousand Petal Hall", Act 3[/b]

[url=https://youtu.be/b0FxzJyytQs?si=bfR4zlEyc6bbOhC6]https://youtu.be/b0FxzJyytQs?si=bfR4zlEyc6bbOhC6[/url] The name of this piece reflects the name of the imperial throne of the fictitious nation of "Shiramatsu" (Bamboo Ruler Country) where Doketsu-mon happened to be travelling through. The nation itself had it been conquered and is now being ruled by a demon king, whom the people despise but cannot depose because of his strength. Doketsu-mon arrives at the coronation ceremony of the demon king and, with his powers, shape-shifts into the king's highest-ranked minister. It is a custom for the name of the ruling monarch to be lengthy, such that they do not share the name with any ordinary person, comprised of many blessings and noble titles; on their coronation, the highest-ranked minister will proclaim this name for the entire nation. Doketsu-mon replaces the demon king's monarchy name with insults, most disguised as praises, to mock the demon king and get him to fight; this insulting title forms the lyrics to the piece:

[i]shiramatsu chocheta ka[/i]     
[i]hara kiru, hata ka nai[/i]
[i]choche doji mono sore[/i]
[i]gaodome taichi ru sai[/i]

[i]doyi chabi, miji no[/i]
[i]sachatsa na ku-dochishimi[/i]
[i]dona chinsai, miai baicha[/i]
[i]taisho-tsa ka tawa-ru[/i]

Ruler of the Bamboo Forest,
who wields the sword but not the brush,
with dragon-like might,
he punishes silence.

A fat heart, the ruler of demons,
a monarch of miniscule peace,
whose great strength but tiny brain,
relies on his generals.
